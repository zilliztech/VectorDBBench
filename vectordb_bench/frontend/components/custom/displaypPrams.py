- `Folder Path` - The path to the folder containing all the files. Please ensure that all files in the folder are in the `Parquet` format.
  - Vectors data files: The file must be named `train.parquet` and should have two columns: `id` as an incrementing `int` and `emb` as an array of `float32`.
  - Query test vectors: The file must be named `test.parquet` and should have two columns: `id` as an incrementing `int` and `emb` as an array of `float32`.
  - Ground truth file: The file must be named `neighbors.parquet` and should have two columns: `id` corresponding to query vectors and `neighbors_id` as an array of `int`.

- `Train File Count` - If the vector file is too large, you can consider splitting it into multiple files. The naming format for the split files should be `train-[index]-of-[file_count].parquet`. For example, `train-01-of-10.parquet` represents the second file (0-indexed) among 10 split files.

- `Use Shuffled Data` - If you check this option, the vector data files need to be modified. VectorDBBench will load the data labeled with `shuffle`. For example, use `shuffle_train.parquet` instead of `train.parquet` and `shuffle_train-04-of-10.parquet` instead of `train-04-of-10.parquet`. The `id` column in the shuffled data can be in any order.
